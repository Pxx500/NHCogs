# NHCogs

Red-DiscordBot V3 cogs maintained for the NewHorizons Discord server.

## Available cogs

The combined `NHCogs` extension loads the maintained cogs:

- [`Honeypot`](NHCogs/honeypot/README.md) detects and reviews suspicious activity,
  captures moderation evidence, and supports automated containment.
- [`NHMisc`](NHCogs/nhmisc/README.md) provides voice logging, sticky roles, activity
  statistics, and other server utilities.
- [`CustomCommands`](NHCogs/custom_commands/README.md) provides weighted text commands,
  Red-compatible placeholders, and thread-based moderator editing.
- [`GitHubTickets`](NHCogs/githubtickets/README.md) publishes pull request review tickets,
  manages developer expertise profiles, and routes reviewer requests.

The combined extension also provides shared technical error reporting. See the
[NHCogs command catalog](NHCogs/README.md) for its configuration commands.
